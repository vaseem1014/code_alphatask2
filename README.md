# Binary Search for Even Numbers in a Range

This Python script is designed to perform a binary search within a specified numeric range and return a list of even numbers within that range. The script ensures that only even numbers are included in the result, and it handles cases where the starting value of the range is odd.

## Usage

1. Run the script.

2. Enter the starting value of the range when prompted.

3. Enter the ending value of the range when prompted.

The script will then:

- Check if the starting value is odd and, if so, increment it to the next even number.
- Construct a list of even numbers within the specified range, including both the start and end values if they are even.
- Display the list of even numbers as the output.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```
Enter the start of the range: 5
Enter the end of the range: 15
[6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
```

In this example, the script identifies the even numbers within the range from 5 to 15 and returns them in a list.
